This project implements a smart elephant fence that uses solar panels for power. The system allows handlers to control elephants safely via signals, measures battery capacity charged by the solar panel, and provides remote control and monitoring through mobile notifications and voice commands without internet connectivity.

## Features

- Battery capacity monitoring
- Signal control for the fence
- Remote control and notifications
